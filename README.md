# College Football WR Performance Study

## Summary
This project will be conducted by a team of students in the Gordon E. Crosby, Jr. MBA Program at the University of Missouri.  The team members are: Edwin Downs, Elie Dvorin, Ryan Frederking, Yisong Li, Phillip Liu, James Stacy, and Kyle Swartz.

## Background
Bill Connelly, a graduate of the Crosby MBA Program, is a well-known sports journalist.  He specializes in analysis and predictability of success for teams as well as players at the collegiate level.  His focus is primarily college football with a little bit of tennis and basketball.  He is an editor for the sports blog site SBNation and Football Outsiders.

## Problem Statement
Bill Connelly has gathered over 10 years of high school and college football data.  This data includes ten years of college football play-by-play data, about 300 games worth of college football charting data, and 10 years of high school recruiting data.  He is looking to employ this data and find more ways to measure position specific efficiency and find ways to tie high school recruiting data to player success at the collegiate level.

## Purpose of study
The purpose of this study is to utilize analytical skills to assist Bill in achieving the results he would like. The team plans to create a logical algorithm(s) that will assist Bill in predicting player success. The team also plans to use knowledge of football and utilize secondary data related to player efficiency at a given position. This will help identify more inputs to produce accurate efficiency measures.

## Scope of study
In this project, the team plans to build a career success rating (CSR) algorithm for college wide receivers based on the true performance rating (TPR) algorithm built during the last project. The team will accept responsibility of collecting players recruiting stats from well-known recruiting websites such as ESPN, 247sports, Rivals.com. Finally, team will try to explore the correlations of CSRs, recruiting stats, and other secondary data regard to players, and build a predictive model for the career success level of college wide receivers.

## Limitations
The research and analysis for Bill Connelly will be limited by a couple of factors.  One factor is time constraint.  The team is limited by the duration of the school semester; in turn this will limit the number of positions for which success projects can be made.  Another limitation is the lack of reliable high school recruiting stats. Unlike the professional perspectives, who need to participate the combine, college perspectives normally self-report important physical attributes such as weight, height and 40-yard dash time. These stats could be unreliable because of self-introduced bias and missing data.
